                            <p>Founded in 2023, the <b><em><u>Lil Rockstars Juicebox / Snackpack Series</u></em></b> began as part of the original Juicebox division in Florida before establishing its roots in Fayetteville, NC.</p>
                            <p>Our journey began with just 25 drivers at our first race. Today, we are proud to have grown to a roster of over 85 racers, ranging in ages from 3 to 7!</p>
                            <p>Our series is about more than just racing. We emphasize the belief that <b><em>‚ÄúGod is #1‚Äù</em></b>, no matter where we finish on the track. We also value the importance of family and friendships, celebrating every victory‚Äîbig or small.</p>
                            <p>And of course, we all strive for the big prize üèÜ!</p>
                            <p>Our mission is simple and clear:</p>
